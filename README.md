#BIOLOGY

This is the project finished in 20 hours - for my biology teacher at high school. She asked to make a website where she can share her lessons, show her achievements, her students' achievements in order to participate on national teachers' competition. 

In this project I used:

- Ruby & Rails5
- PaperClip (for the first time)
